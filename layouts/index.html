  This site is a showcase of experiments in Information Experience Design <a href="https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/degrees/information-experience-design-ms/" target="_blank">(IxD)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The emphasis of each post is on different ways to process and prepare data with the R programming language, while using the Svelte reactive web app framework to present interactive insights into the informative implications of that data.
</p>
  This is a site about signs and symbols in motion. It's purpose is to recognize and explore our need to turn what often appears to be a tsunami or avalanche of data (<em>waves</em>) into familiar and intuitive patterns (<em>currents</em>) which have direction, velocity and stability (or <em>meta-stability</em>).
</p>
<p>
  In terms of information and insight (<em>wisdom</em>), we ask:
  <ul>
    <li>Is the inevitable impact of a tsunami to wreak havoc and destruction, or can it be the first phase of an unfolding wave of chain reactions which simultaneously transform the previous landscape and give birth to a new environment?</li>
    <li>Is disruption a consequence or a cause of novel phenomena, or can it be both?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  We aspire to produce and promote methods for tracing the potential path (<em>locus</em>) of these phenomena, from where they began, to where they may lead, with an emphasis on interpretability, reasonability and usability.
